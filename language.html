        <h2>Language and Communication: Embracing the Basque and Spanish Cultures</h2>
        <p>Understanding the language and culture of a new place is key to feeling at home. In this section, you'll find
            everything you need to know about the official languages of the Basque Country—Basque (Euskara) and
            Spanish—along with useful phrases and tips to help you settle in smoothly.</p>

        <div class="language-info">
            <h3>The Official Languages of the Basque Country</h3>
            <p>The Basque Country has two official languages: <strong>Basque (Euskara)</strong> and <strong>Spanish
                    (Castellano)</strong>. Each language offers its own unique window into the local culture and
                history, and knowing a bit about both will greatly enhance your experience here.</p>

            <h4>Discover Euskara: The Basque Language</h4>
            <p>Euskara is one of the oldest languages in Europe and has no known relation to any other language family.
                This makes it truly unique! While you’ll primarily hear Spanish in most parts of the Basque Country, the
                local population takes pride in Euskara, and learning a few words will go a long way in connecting with
                the community.</p>
            <p><strong>A bit of history:</strong> Euskara has been spoken in the region for centuries. Today, the
                standardized version, <em>Euskara Batua</em>, is taught in schools and used for official communication,
                though different dialects exist in various regions.</p>

        <div class="basic-phrases">
            <h4>Basic Euskara Phrases</h4>
            <p>Ready to try out some Euskara? Here are a few common phrases to get you started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kaixo:</strong> Hello</li>
                <li><strong>Egun on:</strong> Good morning</li>
                <li><strong>Eskerrik asko:</strong> Thank you</li>
                <li><strong>Bai / Ez:</strong> Yes / No</li>
                <li><strong>Barkatu:</strong> Excuse me / Sorry</li>
                <li><strong>Agur:</strong> Goodbye</li>
                <li><strong>Zelan zaude?</strong> How are you?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don’t worry if you don’t speak it fluently—locals are generally very welcoming and appreciative of any
                effort to speak Euskara. Just a simple “Kaixo” (hello) or “Eskerrik asko” (thank you) can brighten
                someone’s day!</p>
